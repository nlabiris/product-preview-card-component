## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Better usage of Flexbox.

### Continued development

Need to work more on absolute length units (i.e. px) and use relative ones more as well as media queries to manage responsiveness better.

### Useful resources

- [Split Div Into 2 Columns Using CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56922082/10871402) - I think the best solution since it shows a modern way to stack divs horizontally or vertically by utilizing the Flexbox properties
- [Why doesn't my image width inherit from parent div width](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24030326/why-doesnt-my-image-width-inherit-from-parent-div-width) - Had some issues with the left side image. At the end, I didn't use it since I changed the `img` element to `div` in order to handle the image source at the CSS level
